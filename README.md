# Harpia: Inhouse Kubernetes Cluster

This is not an officially supported Google product.

Harpia contains tools and recommended configurations that facilitate an inhouse
Kubernetes cluster, covering initial cluster setup, monitoring, network ingress
and storage system. The scripts and configurations are tailored for small- and
medium-sized clusters, in hopes of helping users deploy and run their own.

The name "Harpia", referring to
[a sub-species of eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpy_eagle), is the
largest and most powerful raptor found in the rainforest.
